1. [Gas Turbine](https://github.com/KamalMahanna/Neural-Networks/blob/main/gas_turbines.ipynb)   
The dataset contains 36733 instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine.   
The Dataset includes gas turbine parameters (such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge pressure) in addition to the ambient variables.   
predicting turbine energy yield (TEY) using ambient variables as features.

2. [Forest Fire](https://github.com/KamalMahanna/Neural-Networks/blob/main/forest%20fires.ipynb)   
A Neural Network helps us to find out the category of fire spread with an accuracy of 98%.
